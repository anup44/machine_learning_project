            <p>Amazon is one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, offering a wide range of products and services to customers globally. It was founded in 1994 and has since expanded its offerings to include cloud computing, digital streaming, artificial intelligence, and more. In 2020, Amazon reported net sales of over 386 billion dollars, reflecting the sheer volume of transactions that take place on the platform. Amazon also offers a vast selection of products, with over 2.5 million sellers offering more than a billion products for sale. With such a massive user base and sales volume, Amazon reviews provide a wealth of information for businesses and researchers looking to understand consumer behavior and market trends.
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid rounded-4 mb-4" src="assets/img/amazon_star.png">
            <p>The products available on Amazon cover a wide range of categories, including electronics, books, home goods, beauty products, and clothing. The platform also offers a variety of services such as Prime Video and Amazon Music. The significance of reviews can vary greatly depending on the product category. For example, in categories like electronics, where customers are likely to consider technical specifications, reviews play a key role in helping them make informed decisions. In categories like clothing or beauty products, reviews can provide valuable information on fit, style, and effectiveness, helping customers make decisions based on personal preferences and experiences.
            </p>

            <p>Reviews are an essential part of the Amazon shopping experience, providing customers with valuable insights into the products they're interested in purchasing. Reviewers can rate products on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and provide written comments, photos, and videos about their experience. They can rate products based on various criteria such as quality, value, and customer service. The influence of these reviews on customer purchase decisions and the product's performance, quality, and satisfaction can be significant. The most helpful reviews are prominently displayed on the product page to make it easier for customers to find relevant information. This feedback not only helps customers make informed decisions but also provides businesses with valuable data to improve their offerings.</p>
            <p>The importance of reviews can vary greatly across different product categories on Amazon. For example, in categories such as electronics, technical specifications are often a key consideration, and reviews can play a crucial role in helping customers make informed decisions. In categories like clothing or beauty products, reviews can provide information on fit, style, and effectiveness, allowing customers to make decisions based on personal preferences and experiences. By analyzing trends in customer feedback, businesses can gain valuable insights into the market and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and marketing strategies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Online customer reviews have become an essential source of feedback for businesses of all sizes. These reviews provide businesses with an opportunity to engage with customers and understand their experiences with their products or services. By responding to reviews, businesses can show customers that they value their feedback and are committed to improving their offerings. Moreover, businesses can use review data to track changes in customer satisfaction over time, identify common pain points, and pinpoint areas that require attention. This information can help businesses prioritize their resources and investments to address the most critical issues and ensure customer satisfaction. 
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid rounded-4 mb-4" src="assets/img/amazon_users.webp">

            <p>
              In addition, reviews can be a powerful tool for building brand awareness and credibility. Positive reviews can encourage potential customers to try a product or service, while negative reviews can help businesses identify areas for improvement and show customers that they take feedback seriously. By leveraging review data effectively, businesses can build stronger relationships with their customers and improve their bottom line.

                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> What is the average rating of products across different categories?</li>
                <p>
                  In the data preparation section, we have plotted a graph to check the average rating across categories. The plot can be found <a href="dataprep.html#:~:text=mean%20rating%20in%20reviews" target="_blank">here</a>. We can see that an average rating of over 4 can be found for categories such as ebook Readers and Accessories, Accessories and Supplies, Wearable Technology. All other sections have a mean rating between 3.5 and 4 except for Television and Video, which has an average rating of 3.3.
                </p>

                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i> What is the distribution of reviews across different rating categories?</li>
                <p>
                  The answer to this question can be found <a href="neuralnets.html#:~:text=data%20points%20having%20different%20ratings" target="_blank">here</a>. This result shows that we have a large number of reviews with 5 and 4 star rating and fewer review with low ratings.
                </p>

                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>What are the most commonly used words in product reviews?</li>
                <p>
                  This question can be answered by looking at the wordclouds <a href="dataprep.html#:~:text=code%20will%20generate-,wordclouds,-corresponding%20to%20the" target="_blank">here</a>. We see different words that are used commonly in different categories. For example, we see 'cable' and 'remote' in Accessories & supplies, words like "good", "great", "battery", "price", "picture" in Camera and Photo.
                </p>

                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>What is the correlation between product ratings and the number of reviews?</li>

                  <a href="dataprep.html#:~:text=average%20rating%20that%20a%20product" target="_blank">This</a> plot tries to answer exactly this question. The plot does give a hint that in this dataset, the products that had between 10 to 17 reviews have a slightly higher mean rating. But the trend line suggests that no discernible pattern really exists. However, we see that the fit line is horizintal, meaning that the number of reviews has no relationship with the product ratings.

                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle-fill"></i>What is the relationship between product prices and ratings?</li>

                <p>
                  In this project, we tried to predict product categories using Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVMs and neural networks. Based on this dataset and the work done here, it was observed that Naive Bayes showed best performance (accuracy of 75%) followed by SVMs (accuracy 73%). Decision Trees showed an accuracy of 60% and Neural networks had an accuracy of 56%.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While working on ARMs, we tried to understand the relationships between items that were frequently bought together. In the analysis, it is observed that the data generates about 1.1 million association rules. Although not all rules are very useful, if we are able to find just a few hundred association rules that are meaningful based on their support, confidence and lift values. These rules can help explain several trends in the way users look for items while browsing.

              In this project, we have explored a range of machine learning techniques and algorithms for analyzing Amazon reviews data. By leveraging clustering techniques, Association Rule Mining (ARM), Multinomial Naive Bayes, decision trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and neural networks, we have gained valuable insights into their strengths and limitations when applied to natural language processing tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the key takeaways from our investigation is the importance of careful preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of these algorithms on text data. Specifically, we have shown that clustering techniques can be challenging for sparse and high-dimensional data, but can still reveal important patterns and relationships in the data when combined with careful preprocessing and feature selection. Additionally, our work on ARM has demonstrated the power of this technique for exploring large and complex datasets and driving data-driven decision-making in various fields, including product bundling, complementary offerings, and targeted marketing strategies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our analysis of Multinomial Naive Bayes and decision trees has shown promising results for classifying product categories based on Amazon reviews data. Both approaches offer valuable and interpretable ways of analyzing text data for product categorization, and can be useful for e-commerce businesses looking to improve their product recommendations and marketing strategies. However, we acknowledge the limitations of these approaches, such as the Naive Bayes assumption of independence and the tendency of decision trees to overfit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of machine learning technique that can be used to analyze text data, like Amazon reviews. They are very versatile and can handle a lot of information, which is important because text data is usually very big. SVMs use mathematical functions called "kernels" to make sense of the data and can handle patterns that are not simple or straight. However, SVMs can be complicated to use because they need careful setup and choices, and can take a lot of time to run. In our project, we found that by not adjusting the importance of the different words too much and using a certain type of kernel, we were able to make SVMs work really well on Amazon reviews data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our work on neural networks has shown the potential and limitations of these models for text classification tasks. Neural networks are a type of computer program that can be used to make sense of text data, like Amazon reviews. We made a simple neural network program and used it to guess what category a product belongs to or what rating it should get based on its reviews. Sometimes it worked okay, but there's still a lot of things we can do to make it better. In the future, we could use more advanced versions of neural networks and techniques like dropouts, learning rate schedules, and weighted classes to help it work even better.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, our project has demonstrated the value of machine learning for analyzing Amazon reviews data and informing business strategy. By leveraging the power of clustering, association rule mining, Naive Bayes, decision trees, SVMs, and neural networks, we have uncovered significant patterns and relationships within the data that can help businesses optimize their product offerings and improve customer experiences. We hope that our findings will inspire further research and development in this exciting and rapidly evolving field, and we look forward to seeing how these techniques can continue to improve our understanding of natural language processing and its applications in the business world.
